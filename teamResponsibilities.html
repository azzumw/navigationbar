    				<B>What is it</B>
    			</br>
    				The AAF 02/07 framework, developed by TPR and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, sets out 38 objectives relating to good governance and administration of a scheme.  They're designed to provide a mechanism for master trusts to show that they've been independently assessed on how they meet these requirements.  NEST report on the processes and controls we have in place to meet these objectives and manage any associated risks.  Our controls are independently assessed by KPMG.
    			</br>
    				<B>What we do</B>
    			</br>
    				T&QA own a set of four main controls as listed below.  Each time we have an item that represents the below we need to collate the necessary evidence.  The evidence depends on the method of release - SR, MR or CAB:
    			</br>
    				1.	Evidence of change to charging
    			</br>
    				2.	Evidence of change to members data
    			</br>
    				3.	Evidence of change to retirements processing
    			</br>
    				4.	Evidence of change to software / hardware
    			</br>
    				Twice a year we have to send this information to the controls team.  KPMG then select what they want to see and come in for a face to face to go through the evidence provided.

    				Change Advisory Board (CAB) is where changes ensuring that the NEST pensions website and the technology behind it are running smoothly as well as being up to date. The changes through CAB are managed by both the TCS and NEST Change management teams. Whilst the majority of changes are technical (e.g. software patches to ensure compliance to the latest version or increasing the physical storage for Documentum) NEST T&QA attend the weekly CAB meeting where NEST T&QA review and approve the testing for any Production Incidents/CRs that had/have a member or employer impact within the realm of TAW or areas of PAW that interact with TAW, as well as any changes to the MI Reports. Both the Year End Calendar and Tax Year End updates are also managed via CAB.

    					A Minor Release (MR) is a release is for those defect fixes or improvements where the change is not far reaching in terms of the number of build components modified when compared to a Service Release (SR). There are 3 MRs in a year - 2 smaller MRs (4 week testing window) which are back to back spanning the first half of the year with Go Live dates in April and June. These are followed by a larger MR (7 week testing window) which spans the last quarter of the year with a Go Live date in December.  The overall release is managed by the NEST Change Management team and all the testing is executed by TCS with NEST T&QA reviewing at 20% of the tests executed.

PDF is an open forum that informs and makes recommendations for governing development of the NEST product and proposition, including aspects relating to third party suppliers (TCS).  It acts as a central forum, within NEST, to discuss items or issues likely to impact the product, or require product change. These are then added to the PDF log and monitored using a timeline discussed at the time.  PDF is comprised of stakeholders from across NEST - to enable issues presented to be shared with and reviewed by the wider organisation. Once an issue has been reviewed by PDF and appropriate actions for change identified (where relevant), it will no longer be monitored via the PDF log.  Instead, it will form part of the existing change process for the specific type of change (i.e. SR, MR, CR, CAB).

    				Following Scheme Launch in October 2012 further enhancements that are agreed to be implemented into the system take a structured approach for implementation.  These enhancements are divided into Service Releases (SR) which provided a series of functionality changes and additions which were either not delivered during or were planned to be delivered post Scheme Launch. Typically, there are two SR's a year, being deployed into production early March and early September.
    			</br>
    				<B>What we do</B>
    			</br>
    				T&QA are responsible for ensuring the implementation of the functional changes or new additions are robust and fit for purpose.  We do this via liaising with our 3rd party development supplier (TCS) who are accountable for all testing.
    			</br>
    				T&QA have structured test phases for a SR and these are Test control, Test Planning, Test Analysis and Design, Test Implementation, Test Execution and Test Closure. Under each phase there is a vast list of tasks which the TM manages. For more information on each test phase please refer to the Service release Test Plan document.

    				A User Journey is a document which details the "happy path" scenario for a given area of functionality, via step by step instructions and screenshots. The testing team maintains a collection of User Journeys that may be used both inside the team and within the wider company.
    			</br>
    				<B>What we do</B>
    			</br>
    				These user journeys are organised and managed to keep the information up to date such that existing user journeys are periodically updated and new user journeys are created for functionality that does not yet have one.
